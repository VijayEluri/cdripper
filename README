Java project that contains two command line programs.

One to rip a music CD, pulling music info from CDDB.

The other encodes the CD to a variety of formats (currently flac, mp3 and ogg). Encoding is done in parallel to speed things up.

All ripping and encoding is done by executing binaries: cdparanoia cdda2wav flac lame oggenc

It's only ever been used on Linux and may take some work to run on Windows or OS X.
