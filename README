Java project that contains two command line programs.

One to rip a music CD, pulling music info from CDDB.

The other encodes the CD to a variety of formats (currently flac, mp3 and ogg). Encoding is done in parallel to speed things up.

All ripping and encoding is done by executing binaries: cdparanoia cdda2wav flac lame oggenc

This is for ripping on OSX, see master branch for Linux.

Setting up the tools (assumes homebrew usage).

    brew update
    brew install cdrtools cdparanoia libcddb libcdio flac lame
